# Map Page

This runs on free map technology called `leaflet`. The colour coding for stations shows current air quality in the Basin regarding ozone. Grey indicates a current missing value.  

Clicking the coloured marker will bring up a pop-up with the station name and current levels of air-quality values. There (TODO) is a link to further time series of observations for that station. Color-coding is according to the EPA's Air Quality Index (AQI) and the legend is shown in the bottom right of the map. 

The lower left toggled map show the area in which the BRC focus their ozone research. Note the map uses data from Tribal monitoring stations as well as BRC's own - TODO check the networks - WHAT ABOUT RANGELY? 

You can zoom with the arrows (top left) or with the mouse wheel. The map can be dragged to show different areas. ELSPETH - CAN YOU USE KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS TOO

The map is updated every 5 minutes.
