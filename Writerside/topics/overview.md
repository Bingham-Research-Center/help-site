# UBAIR: Uintah Basin Air Quality Website


The Uintah Basin air quality website is provided by the [Bingham Research Center](https://www.usu.edu/binghamresearch/) at Utah State University. The website provides current air-quality conditions for the Uintah Basin, as well as forecasts of ozone levels and weather conditions. There is an emphasis on winter ozone, a unique problem in the Uintah Basin, to support BRC's [_Ozone Alert_](https://www.usu.edu/binghamresearch/ozone-alert) program. 

## Products

The site provides these main features:

> - **Map of current conditions**: Real-time data from BRC and Tribal monitoring stations.
> - **Forecasts**: Predictions of ozone levels and weather conditions.
